My program takes in command line arguments to convert words into old school 9 number keypad texting digits or the other way around
Use the makefile to compile my code
Using the "-h" flag anywhere in the command line argument will just bring up the help menu
The 2nd and 3rd arguments after the executable are going to be the input and output files respectively
When using the "-L" flag to convert letters to digits, the first argument that's not the flag or executable will be the input and the second argument that's not the flag or executable will be the output
The input and ouptut files will be validated such that they end in .txt, and the input file actually exists and can be opened. If these conditions are not met, an error message will be displayed stating the invalidity
However once given a valid file, the contents of the file will not be validated
The input file should start with the number of lines of text to be processed
Each line will then have their respective input types with no spaces and no special characters and the result will be saved to the output file
